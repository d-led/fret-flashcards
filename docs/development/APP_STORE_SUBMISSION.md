## üö® Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Build Failures
```bash
# Clean and rebuild
npm run build:mobile
npx cap sync ios
```

#### Screenshot Generation Issues
```bash
# Check simulator availability
xcrun simctl list devices

# Reset simulators if needed
xcrun simctl erase all
```

#### Screenshot Upload Issues
```bash
# Verify screenshots exist before upload
ls -la ios/screenshots/en-US/

# Check screenshot file sizes (should be reasonable)
du -h ios/screenshots/en-US/*.png

# Upload screenshots individually if batch fails
npm run app-store:screenshots:add  # Safer option
```

#### Fastlane Issues
```bash
# Update fastlane
sudo gem update fastlane

# Check fastlane configuration
cd ios && fastlane lanes
```

#### CocoaPods Issues
```bash
# Known issue with Xcode 26 compatibility
# The validation script handles this automatically
# Manual fix if needed:
cd ios/App && pod install
```

### Validation Failures

If validation fails, check the generated report:
```bash
cat app-store-validation-report.json
```

Common fixes:
- Missing screenshots: Run `npm run screenshots`
