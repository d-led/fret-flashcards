## Features

- Practice identifying notes on any string and fret.
- Choose between a basic 0-11th fret practice or 21, 22 or 24 frets with multiple notes to find on one string.
- Optionally include sharps/flats in quizzes.
- 3‚Äì10 strings with ready-made presets and per-string custom tuning.
- Reset tuning to standard 6-string configuration.
- Visual cues and audio feedback for correct/incorrect answers.
- Settings persist across browser sessions so your preferences are retained.
- Optional quiz bias towards strings of the current tuning with the most mistakes.
- You don't actually need a stringed instrument for practicing at all: try turning on the score notation and turning off the quiz note hint. Sing or play it on any instrument!
- You don't have to look at the monitor either: enable the synthetic "voice hints" (might not work in all browsers).
