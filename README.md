## Features

- Practice identifying notes on any string and fret
- Choose between a basic 0-11th fret practice or 21, 22 or 24 frets with multiple notes to find on one string
- Optionally include sharps/flats in quizzes
- 3â€“10 strings with ready-made presets and per-string custom tuning
- Reset tuning to standard 6-string configuration
- Visual cues and audio feedback for correct/incorrect answers
- Settings persist across browser sessions so your preferences are retained
- Optional quiz bias towards strings of the current tuning with the most mistakes
- You don't actually need a stringed instrument for practicing at all: try turning on the score notation and turning off the quiz note hint. Sing or play it on any instrument!

## Deployment

- Live at: https://d-led.github.io/fret-flashcards

## Quick start

## Inspiration

Inspired by Steve Vai's anecdote about the first homework given to him by Joe Satriani: "learn all notes on the fretboard".
